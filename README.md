# Color Splash Memory Game
A game for the little ones, to learn colors in a playful way. This memory game has four colours hidden below it's cards and by clicking on each card the user is supposed to find its corresponding match!

## UX (User and business owners goal)

### As a business owner:
* As a business owner I want to introduce an interactive game to the smaller ones that can learn to identify colors

### As a user:
* As a very young user I want to in an interactive way play a game to learn colors

## Features

The website is a one-page site with focus on the game itself. It is userfriendly and adapted to all sorts of devices. 

* Game is reset and starts as blank once a page is loaded.
* Timer: The timer is starting once the user starts to interact with the game, and ends when the memory game is solved, with all color matches being found.
* Moves: this section counts every move the user uses to find the pairs. One move is eaqual to two cards being showed.
* Result: At the end of the game the results section shows the final results of amounts of moves and the time which the game was completed on.
* Start-again button: Once clicked upon the game is reset and the user can start a new round, where the cards have been shuffled and randomly replocated.


## Technologies used

### HTML 
* The language to set the structure.

### CSS
* The language to style the page.

### Google Fonts
* As a font resource. 

### GitHub
* As a software hosting platform to store the project on in a remote location.

### Gitpod
* As a development hosting platform.

## Testing

### Functionality testing
* I used Google Developer tool *Inspector* throughout the development to imediately see the function of the site live and spot bugs. The *Console* has been very useful for Javascript. 
* The game is intentially missing aria-labels since there were no buttons/links to add this to. 

### Compatibility testing
* Site has been tested on devices between 1000px wide and down to 350px in Developer Tools, but mainly on my browser in MacBook Air 11'. 

## Issues found during site development

### Layout:
* Issues with the cards fitting and staying in the container has been a recurring problem on smaller devices. I should have set it up differently, in grids, from the beginning but tried to solve the issue with Media Queries for all devices down to 350px, by changing the size on the cards to fit into its game-container. 

* Images were loading very slowly although I resized them, so I used TINYPNG.com to compress them as well. 

### Javascript:
* My knowledge and understanding of Javascript was very weak in the beginning of this site development and I could not wrap my head around the logic of Javascript at all. I used tutorials on Youtube, lots of research on projects from other peers at Code Institue to even understand how to get started. 
I have had more issues than success building this site and although it is not as well structured and developed as I had wished for I am proud of my learning outcome and better understanding of the language. 

* Data-Image: I set up the card structure in HTML and with data-image attribute attached on each card, however they did not connect to Javascript by flipping. The issue I finally figured with one of the tutors at Code Institute was the placement of 'data-image', not being on the same div as ".memory-card".

* Flip Cards: I used inspiration from [Marina Ferreira](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYS4J9m3SsU&list=PLLX1I3KXZ-YH-woTgiCfONMya39-Ty8qw&index=5) to have my card flipped but due to mistakes between CSS and Javascript it did not work and I figured out another CSS structure from W3 Schools with my tutor. 

* Checking cards for match: Here I learnt that the functions need to have argument being passed into the function to work. I started setting up the functions with empty brackets wihch caused issues. 
Also that the array of the two flipped cards need to be empty in roder for two new cards to be flipped and checked for a match. This I solved with the slice method: *selectedPairs.splice(0, selectedPairs.length);*

* Moves-counter function: This did not work due to a space after *counter* but when I removed that it accumulated the scores. 
*document.getElementById("count-area-moves").innerHTML = counter++;*

* Overall I have had structural issues due to lack of knowledge, but have improved my skills with a lot of help from the tutors and online videos. 
It also became much easier when I started to add alerts, and once I got the hung of them add the console.logs to see the issues. 

## Bugs

* Game only flipps three cards: 
Although spending all awake time on this site the past week I could not figure out the very end and make the game work properly. I believe it is a bug the DOM since game freezes after three cards being flipped. In the console it logs the value of "Window", so it looks like it is stepping out of the "document".

* Moves-counter: The counter is set up and works but counts the moves after the third card being flipped. In the console it looks like it's an issue with my logic.



## Performance testing

I ran the site in Lighthouse to check its performance:

## Validation

I validated my codes and after a few adjustments at first it ran without any errors:

* [W3C CSS Validator](http://www.css-validator.org/) to validate CSS
* [Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate HTML
* [Jshint Javascript Checker](https://jshint.com/) runs with no errors.

## Deployment

The page has been deployed to Github Pages following below steps:

* On the Github repository page navigate to Settings in the menu field.
Scroll down to Pages
* Under Source change the branch to main
* Press Save
* The site is published and can be found [here](https://viktoriamahrberg.github.io/color-splash-memory/).
* To run localy:
On the Github repository page, click Code button do download zip file
After download you can extract the file and use it in your local environment.
